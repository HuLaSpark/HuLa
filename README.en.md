## Project Introduction

HuLa is an instant messaging system developed with Tauri, Vite 6, Vue 3, and TypeScript. It leverages the cross-platform capabilities of Tauri and the reactive design of Vue 3, combined with TypeScript's type safety features and the fast build system of Vite 6, to provide users with an efficient, secure, and easy-to-use communication solution.

## Technology Stack

- **Tauri**: Provides a lightweight, high-performance desktop application container, enabling the development of cross-platform desktop applications with a web technology stack. Tauri's design philosophy aims to minimize resource consumption while ensuring security.
- **Vite 6**: A modern front-end build tool that uses native ES module import to offer a fast development server. At the same time, it provides robust support for production builds. Vite 6 is its latest version, bringing more optimizations and features.
- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Its Composition API, improved TypeScript integration, and optimizations for mobile platforms make developing complex single-page applications simpler and more efficient.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds a type system to the language. It enables catching more errors during development and provides better support from editors.
